# Mosaic-creator
A python script that creates a image made out of images.

You can use this script however you want. Credit would be nice but is not required.

The program use numpy and cv2

# How to use

1. Run the executable
2. Enter the path where you have the images stored that you want to make up the image.
3. Enter the path to the image you want to recreate.
4. Enter what image you want to make the input images. This is the determining factor for the eventual size of the image. I do not recommend going over 250 but you can choose whatever you want. If the number you choose is greater than the resolution of the input images than the program will enlarge them.
5. Enter the amount of pixel you want each input image will take up. This is the determining factor for how long the program will take.
6. Wait till the program says done. Then look in the same folder that you have the python script for Mosaic.png. The image will most likely be very big.

# The Hollow knight example

The mosaic image was to big to upload to github even compressed. But you can recreate it yourself. You use the input images and the input image with values 59 at step 4 and 1 at step 5.
